### Ary Alexandre 
As an enthusiast of technology, I challenge myself every day to expand my skill set and solidify my proficiency as a programmer. My repository includes numerous Full Stack projects. I also love developing video games in my spare time, currently using Godot and Blender. My YouTube channel is available for curious minds.
